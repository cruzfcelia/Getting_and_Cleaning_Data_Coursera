Getting and Cleaning Data Assignement - Coursera
Célia F. Cruz 2016


This is the assignement for the Coursera Course "Getting and Cleaning Data". 
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

The R script called run_analysis.R does the following:
1. Merges the training and the test sets, already unzip in the directory folder, to create one data set.
2. Extracts the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set (tidy_data.txt) with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
